                <h2>Common Gaps Seen by Recruiters</h2>
                <p>Based on our experience placing UX professionals in Swiss companies, these are the most frequent areas where candidates fall short of market expectations.</p>

                <h3>Portfolio and Presentation Issues</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p><strong>Most common problems:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Too visual, not enough strategy:</strong> Portfolios showing final designs without explaining the problem-solving process</li>
                        <li><strong>Weak business impact:</strong> Missing metrics, ROI, or measurable outcomes from design work</li>
                        <li><strong>Vague role descriptions:</strong> Unclear about individual contributions vs. team achievements</li>
                        <li><strong>Process over results:</strong> Focusing on methods used rather than problems solved and impact created</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Skill Set Misalignment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tool-focused rather than methodology-focused:</strong> Emphasizing software skills over design thinking</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of business understanding:</strong> Unable to connect design decisions to business objectives</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited cross-functional experience:</strong> Little evidence of working with developers, product managers, or other stakeholders</li>
                    <li><strong>Weak research foundation:</strong> Designs not grounded in user insights or data</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cultural and Communication Challenges</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Insufficient stakeholder management:</strong> Difficulty explaining and defending design decisions to non-designers</li>
                    <li><strong>Over-emphasis on creativity:</strong> Not demonstrating systematic, analytical approach valued in Swiss market</li>
                    <li><strong>Language barriers:</strong> Underestimating importance of German/French for role success</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural adaptation:</strong> Not showing understanding of Swiss work culture and expectations</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Recruiter insight:</strong> Swiss employers often prefer candidates who can clearly articulate their design rationale, demonstrate measurable impact, and show evidence of successful collaboration with business stakeholders. Pure creative skills are less valued than strategic design thinking.</p>
